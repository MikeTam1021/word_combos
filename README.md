# word_combos
Find all words from letters in english language!   

### Purpose and History

My niece was playing a game with riddles. The game provides ten letters and then has a word that can be any length (usually between 3 and 7 letters). Rather than 'paying' for a hint with coins earned by successfully completing riddles, I figured we should find out all possible words with a little code.    

Took ten minutes to write, faster than solving some of the riddles!      

### How to use

Just call the file with arguments as the letters and the number of words. It will print out any legitimate words.

`python word_checks.py 'letters' int_words_length`

example:

`python word_checks.py 'refciikeus' 5`

output:

`
ecrus
creek
skier
fucks
curfs
feces
frees
reefs
cruse
curse
fires
icier
ricks
scree
ficus
frisk
reuse
fusee
serif
rices
cures
